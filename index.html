      Phase Changes

      Have you ever wondered how matter can change from one form to another? Have you ever wondered what this process was called? Have you
      ever wondered what enthalpy is? Well if not, find out more here!
      Before we get into this, it is recommended that you read about the states of matter before you learn about phase changes.
      The act of matter changing from one state to another is called a phase change. The amount of heat required to change
      matter from one state to another is called enthalpy, and from solid to plasma is called enthalpy of system. Now let's get into
      the phase changes, with our starting point being a solid. So let's say our solid is an ice cube. If we heat up the ice cube, it turns into
      water. The process of a solid turning into a liquid is called melting, which, I'm sure is an obvious term to everyone here. Ok, so we got
      a liquid. If we heat it up then we get water vapor, when water is at its gas point. The process of a liquid turning into gas is called vaporization.
      Now let's go back to our solid point. This next phase change is interesting, because solids can turn directly into gases, meaning that it doesn't have
      to be a liquid first before becoming a gas. It requires 273 degrees celsius to do this. The process of doing this is called sublimation, when solids turn directly into gas. Ok, so back to our gas point.
      If you saw the states of matter article, then you'll know plasma is a superheated gas. So, if we heat up the gas enough, it can become a plasma. The process of doing this is called ionization. Now
      we are at our plasma point. If we cool down the plasma, we can get gas again. The process of doing this is called recombination. Now, if we cool it down enough, we can get back to our solid point.
      The process of doing this is called deposition, from a gas directly to a solid. But, we'll take the long way and turn it into a liquid first. The process of turning a gas to a liquid is called condensation.
      Now we are back to our liquid point. If we cool it down more, we'll be back to our solid point. This is called freezing, which, again, I'm sure is an obvious term to everyone here.
      So I hope you enjoyed our enthalpy of system journey. Again, you can read the states of matter article to get a better understanding of these changes, and if you didn't get something, be sure to read
      the glossary.
